### Detecting Human Engagement in Social Robots
Facial Emotion Recognition(FER) is a challenging Computer Vision task to reveal information of a person√ïs emotion state. They have a wide range of applications, and one among them is detecting facial emotions of toddlers in classrooms for the social assistive robot sitting in front of them to make a decision based on the revealed emotion. We explore various models to first detect discrete emotions on the FER2013 dataset, starting from the state-of-the-art architectures, and later move on to output the subtle aspects of emotions, namely valence and arousal, using a wide ensemble model.
